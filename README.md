## Overview

### Introduction to Ca√©r Finance

Welcome to **Ca√©r Finance**, a cross-chain lending and borrowing protocol purpose-built to serve as a foundational DeFi primitive on the EduChain network.

Ca√©r is designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and scalable decentralized financial services by enabling users to lend, borrow, and manage collateral across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Through this approach, Ca√©r enhances capital efficiency while contributing directly to Total Value Locked (TVL) and transaction volume on EduChain.

Leveraging the capabilities of Espresso‚Äôs Application-Specific Sequencer (ASS) and a solver-based coordination architecture, Ca√©r ensures trustless cross-chain execution with rapid finality. This infrastructure eliminates reliance on centralized bridges and custodians, promoting decentralization without compromising performance or security.

As one of the first lending protocols deployed on EduChain, Ca√©r plays a critical role in expanding the network‚Äôs ecosystem. It serves as a modular, composable financial layer that other decentralized applications can integrate with‚Äîthereby supporting broader protocol interoperability and future ecosystem growth.

By offering a robust DeFi experience with a focus on TVL growth, cross-chain liquidity access, and institutional-grade infrastructure, Ca√©r aims to position EduChain as a compelling destination for users and developers seeking novel, blockchain-based financial solutions.

## What is Ca√©r Finance?

**Ca√©r Finance** is a next-generation cross-chain lending and borrowing protocol developed to serve as a foundational decentralized finance (DeFi) primitive within the EduChain ecosystem. It facilitates seamless asset supply, borrowing, and management across multiple blockchain networks through a unified platform, eliminating the need for centralized custodians or traditional bridging mechanisms.

At its core, Ca√©r is powered by an Application-Specific Sequencer (ASS), designed to manage transaction ordering, data verification, and execution across chains in a secure, transparent, and trustless manner. This sequencer ensures consistency and correctness in cross-chain operations, enabling reliable financial interactions at scale.

To reinforce transaction integrity and ensure timely finality, Ca√©r integrates with the Espresso protocol, leveraging its decentralized finality layer. Through this integration, Ca√©r benefits from rapid and secure confirmation of cross-chain transactions while maintaining alignment with the principles of decentralization and verifiability.

By combining protocol-specific sequencing with robust cross-chain finality infrastructure, Ca√©r delivers a modular, secure, and high-performance lending platform‚Äîpositioning itself as a critical driver of liquidity, adoption, and composability across the EduChain ecosystem and beyond.

## How We Achieve Cross-Chain Capability

To enable seamless cross-chain lending and borrowing in Ca√©r, we utilize a structured process that ensures security and efficiency. Our system leverages the Application-Specific Sequencer (ASS), Espresso confirmations, and solvers to facilitate interactions across different chains. ASS plays a crucial role in verifying data across chains, ensuring valid transactions, and maintaining system integrity.

### Cross-Chain Lending Workflow

1. **User Collateral Deposit**  
   The user deposits 1 WETH as collateral on Chain A.

2. **User Loan Request**  
   The user initiates a request to borrow 100 USDC on Chain B.

3. **ASS Verification**  
   ASS verifies the deposit on Chain A to ensure the user has sufficient collateral.

4. **Espresso Confirmation & ASS Signature Generation**  
   Finality achieved within ~15 seconds via Espresso; ASS then signs to validate transaction.

5. **Transaction Processing**  
   Transaction with ASS signature is submitted on Chain B.

6. **Solver Loan Execution**  
   Solver confirms the request and releases 100 USDC to the user on Chain B.

> **Note:**  
> For the purposes of this hackathon, we are using mock tokens to simulate transactions and interactions within the platform. Additionally, the platform is operating on a testnet environment.

## Swap
![Swap Screenshot](https://caer-finance.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F479864240-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fr1WgeDLAmHGxwGPod7U5%252Fuploads%252FURCgJJNdH1C9kWN5Jn94%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D89c07a04-0ea6-46f4-b0fa-de6b9e673de4&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=5f13d697&sv=2)
Ca√©r implements a decentralized swap mechanism inspired by Automated Market Maker (AMM) models, enabling seamless token exchanges within the Ca√©r Pool.


### 1. Liquidity Provider üíß
Liquidity Providers (LPs) deposit pairs of tokens (e.g., Token A and Token B) into the **Ca√©r Pool**.

In return, LPs receive **Pool Tokens**, which represent their share of the liquidity pool and entitle them to a proportion of the transaction fees generated from swaps.

### 2. Ca√©r Pool Management üóÉÔ∏è
The **Ca√©r Pool** maintains reserves of the deposited tokens and continuously updates balances as users perform swap operations.

These reserves are used to facilitate trades between Token A and Token B **without relying on external order books**.

### 3. Swap Mechanism üîÑ
Traders initiate swaps through the **Ca√©r Swap** interface by selecting the tokens they wish to exchange ‚Äî such as swapping Token A for Token B.

**What makes Ca√©r unique:**

To access swap functionalities, users **must hold an active lending or borrowing position**.  
This ensures that swaps are **directly integrated with the lending and borrowing protocol**, enabling **capital efficiency** and **enhanced liquidity management**.

The swap functionality applies an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** formula to determine the exchange rate, considering the current reserves of the involved tokens.

Upon successful execution, the **Ca√©r Pool** updates the reserves accordingly.


### 4. Transaction Fees üí∏
A small fee is applied to each swap, **distributed to Liquidity Providers based on their share of the pool**.

These fees **incentivize LPs to maintain liquidity** within the pool, enhancing platform efficiency and accessibility.

### 5. Liquidity Withdrawal üì§
LPs can withdraw their liquidity at any time by **redeeming their Pool Tokens**.

Upon withdrawal, the provider receives their **proportional share of the pool‚Äôs reserves** along with any **accumulated fees**.

> For the purposes of this hackathon, we are using **mock tokens** to simulate transactions and interactions within the platform.  
> Additionally, the platform is operating on a **testnet environment**.
